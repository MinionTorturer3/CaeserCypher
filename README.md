## Goal
Create an encryption and decryption tool that will be able to use the algorithm to hide and reveal messages using **Python**
### How the Cypher Works
The cypher takes a number that the user wants to shift the characters by and uses it through going through each character of the word in order to encrypt it.
### How the Decypher Works
Using a brute force method which would be used by someone who intercepts an encrypted message, it goes trhough each number of possibilities up to 26 (as this is the number of letters in the alphabet) to try and decypher what the message is.
